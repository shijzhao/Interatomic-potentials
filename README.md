To model multiprincipal elemental alloys using molecular dynamics, we need to know their interatomic interactions. In our previous work, we have parameterized the EAM potential for V based on the formalisms proposed by Zhou et al.[Phys. Rev. B. 69 144113 (2004)]. Combine with available parameters, we are able to simulate multicomponent alloys composed of different metals, including Fe, V, Cr, Mo, Ta, W. The complete potential file that we have used is provided here. The parameters, as provided in this publication, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2021.117233, are listed as below:
